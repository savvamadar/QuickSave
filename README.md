Notes

- The Dropbox API is used for storing files.
- Geckofx used for internal browser.
- Shout out to Dmitri Salov for this idea. (https://github.com/dmitrisalov)

Description
-----------
This simple GUI tool is used for synchronizing files across multiple machines with their respective filepaths using the user's
Dropbox account.


Example Usage
-------------
A user has a file which contains stored data for an application with a file path of "C:\App\saveData\dat.sav". If the user has a second
machine with the same application installed, they will likely want to continue working from the same saved data. To do this, the user
must transfer the file from their first machine to their second one by using a flash drive, email service, or a cloud service. The user
must go through the process of recieving the file on their second machine, then moving it to its proper location "C:\App\saveData\dat.sav".
Through QuickSave, the user may bypass this tedious process by simply launching the tool from their first machine, uploading the save file,
launching QuickSave from their other machine, and synchronizing. This will quickly place the save file in the same directory on the second
machine as it was on the first machine. From now on, the user may synchronize this file through QuickSave so that the most
up-to-date version of the file will be stored in their Dropbox account and readily available on their machines just one, or two, clicks away.
